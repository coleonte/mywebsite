# Work Details

## Link to the live resume: 

I created my first interactive online resume using HTML, CSS and Object-Oriented JavaScript(jquery).  The resume data is stored in 4 JavaScript objects. 

The resume has 4 sections: work, education,  and a header with my bio. It also has an interactive Google Map with pins of location where I lived and worked -- all over the world.



update: it's a desktop version but I will try to adapt it for the mobile version as well
